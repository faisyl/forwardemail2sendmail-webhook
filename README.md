# web2mail

A professional and slick Go application that acts as a bridge, relaying webhooks seamlessly to your email inbox via SMTP or Sendmail.

## Overview

**web2mail** provides a universal webhook endpoint for services like ForwardEmail.net. It receives email data as a JSON payload, reconstructs it into a proper RFC 5322 compliant email (with full MIME support for HTML and attachments), and relays it via your choice of backend: local Postfix (sendmail) or remote SMTP.

## Features

- ✅ **Slick Landing Page** with real-time status and configuration details
- ✅ **Multiple Backends**: Support for local `sendmail` or remote `SMTP`
- ✅ **Full MIME support**: Handles plain text, HTML, and complex attachments
- ✅ **HMAC Security**: Signature verification for secure webhook processing
- ✅ **Self-Contained**: Embedded assets for a zero-dependency frontend
